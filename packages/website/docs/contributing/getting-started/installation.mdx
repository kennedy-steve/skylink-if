# Installation

:::caution

UNDER CONSTRUCTION

:::


## Clone the repository

If you're new to git, cloning is kind of like downloading.

In your terminal, navigate to where you want to store this, and future, projects. Then run this command:

```
git clone https://github.com/kennedy-steve/skylink-if.git
```

Next, navigate into the skylink-if directory, which was created when you did `git clone`.

```
cd skylink-if
```

Alternatively, you could open VSCode and open the `skylink-if` directory.

## Install dependencies

I like to use `yarn` for dependency management, but you can use `npm` if you prefer.

```
yarn install
```

## Create /config/config.json

The easiest thing to do is contact a maintainer of the project and ask them to create a config file for you. But if you're on your own, follow these instructions:

1. [Create a discord bot](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me)
2. [Create a bot token](https://discordjs.guide/preparations/setting-up-a-bot-application.html)
3. [Get an Infinite Flight Live API Key](hhttps://infiniteflight.com/guide/developer-reference/live-api/overview#obtaining-an-api-key)
4. Copy the `config.example.json` file and name it `config.json`.
5. Populate all fields named `<field>` with the appropriate values.

## Register /slash commands

```
yarn register

```

## Run the bot

The bot is technically a server. Let's run it!

```
yarn start:dev
```

If you want to play with the bot, create a test server and [invite your bot to it](https://discordjs.guide/preparations/adding-your-bot-to-servers.html).
