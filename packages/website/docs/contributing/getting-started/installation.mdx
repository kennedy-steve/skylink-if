# Installation

If you want to run Skylink-IF locally, you'll need to install and configure Skylink-IF

## Clone the repository

If you're new to git, cloning is kind of like downloading.
In your terminal, navigate to where you want to store this, and future, projects. Then, `git clone` the repository.

```
git clone https://github.com/kennedy-steve/skylink-if.git
```

<Terminal command={GitCloneRepository} />
<br />

Alternatively, you could use VSCode to clone and open skylink-if.

## Install dependencies

I like to use `yarn` for dependency management, but you can use `npm` if you prefer.

```
yarn install
```

<Terminal command={YarnInstallDependencies} />
<br />


## Create /config/config.json

The easiest thing to do is contact a maintainer of the project and ask them to create a config file for you. But if you're on your own, follow these instructions:

1. [Create a discord bot](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me)
2. [Create a bot token](https://discordjs.guide/preparations/setting-up-a-bot-application.html)
3. [Get an Infinite Flight Live API Key](hhttps://infiniteflight.com/guide/developer-reference/live-api/overview#obtaining-an-api-key)
4. Copy the `config.example.json` file and name it `config.json`.
5. Populate all fields named `<field>` with the appropriate values.

## Register /slash commands

Discord slash commands are a new way to create commands for your Discord bot. They are new and Discord has made it clear that they want slash commands to be used as much as possible. You can read more about them [here](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/1500000368501-Slash-Commands-FAQ).

```
yarn run register
```

<Terminal command={YarnRegisterCommands} />
<br />



## Run the bot

Running the bot isn't just about making it active and listening for commands, it also starts running scheduled jobs such as notifications for active Infinite Flight users.

```
yarn start:dev
```

<Terminal command={YarnStartBot} />
<br />

If you want to play with the bot, create a test server and [invite your bot to it](https://discordjs.guide/preparations/adding-your-bot-to-servers.html).
