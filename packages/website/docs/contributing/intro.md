# Introduction

Hi I'm Nate, and I'll be introducing you to Skylink-IF. Skylink-IF development is not yet in full throttle. We still need to create and document a roadmap for the future of Skylink-IF before we lay down the code. 

:::tip Join Us

To join our initial development team or have say in the decision process, [join our discord](https://dsc.gg/skylink).

## So when will development start?

We want to have the following before we can start development as a team:

    âœ… A Website
    âœ… Proof-of-Concept Bot
    ðŸ”„ Documentation for development
    â¬œ Suggested features from interested users
    â¬œ Roadmap developed by core developers and stakeholders


## What do I need to know?

Below, you'll find resources for learning the technologies Skylink-IF uses, such as Typescript. I'm actually new to most of these, so I'll be adding resources that have really helped me along the way.

### Typescript

Skylink-IF (and this website too) use TypeScript. Essentially, it's just strongly-typed JavaScript. I myself, nate, am new to TypeScript. Never used it before LOL. I'm taking this opportunity to learn it, so if you are brand new too, well, you've picked the right project. I'll be documenting the resources I use to learn TypeScript.

* [TypeScript Documentation](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/everyday-types.html)

### Discord.js

Discord.js is a library that allows you to connect to Discord servers. It's the reason why we are using TypeScript -- if we're learning JavaScript, we might as well learn TypeScript. The alternative was to use Discord.py, which is a Python library; however, it is currently unmaintained ðŸ˜¢.
