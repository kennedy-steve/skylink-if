# Commands

Welcome to the Source of Truth for all Skylink-IF commands! This is a work in progress, so please be patient.

## General commands

Commands anyone can use! 

### `/help`

We all know this command. Lists available commands for Skylink-IF bot.

#### Demo

<DiscordTerminal>
  <span data-disco="input">/help</span>
  <span data-disco>I have the following commands: /help, /register-me, /get-pilot</span>
</DiscordTerminal>

### `/register-me`

Register your Infinite Flight account with Skylink-IF. This will allow your friends and servers to see your activity on Infinite Flight. 
You'll also be able to unlock future features!

#### Ground Crew Verification

When you register, Skylink-IF will Direct Message you instructions for verification. You will be asked to spawn in Infinite Flight with a certain livery and True Heading. 
Our ground crew will then verify that you followed the instructions we gave you. This process may take a couple of minutes, and Skylink-IF will notify you when it's complete. 
This process prevents abuse of registration.

#### Demo

<DiscordTerminal>
  <span data-disco="input">/register-me infinite-flight-username: N8te</span>
  <span data-disco>ðŸ¤– To register as N8te please spawn as a Boeing-737 and turn to a heading of 123 Degrees.</span>
  <span data-disco>ðŸ¤– Our ground crew see your aircraft, but something is off... Double check your aircraft and heading.</span>
  <span data-disco>ðŸ¤– Our ground crew have checked your aircraft. You are now verified!</span>

</DiscordTerminal>

## Admin commands

### `/enable-notifications`
