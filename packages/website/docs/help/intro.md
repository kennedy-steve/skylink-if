# Introduction

Let's get down to it. Skylink-IF uses `/slash` commands for basically everything. Here's a short list of Skylink-IF's commands:

* `/help` - Brief description of commands and features 
* `/register-me` - Register yourself Infinite Flight account. It's quick and gives you access to cool features ðŸ˜Ž 
* `/get-pilot <Infinite Flight Username>` - Get a pilot's information.
* `/enable-notifications` - Enable active pilot and/or controller notifications in a channel. 
* `/disable-notifications` - Disable notifications in a channel.

For more detailed information, checkout the [command page](/docs/help/commands) (we have some cool animations there ðŸ˜‰).
